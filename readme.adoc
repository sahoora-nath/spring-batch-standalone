= Spring Batch Standalone Application

toc::[]

== Goals

* Using the `spring-batch` as standalone application.
* Use of StAX Reader to a read block of XML file and process the data and inserting into mySQL DB.
* This is useful while processing large XML files.
* The commit interval and failure scenario can be handled with the leverage of spring batch.

== Overview

This spring-batch demo will demonstrate how the API can be used to process bulk data in controlled way.
These services can be extended to put the failed blocks in a separate file.

== Prerequisites

- JDK 1.8
- Apache Maven 3.2.3

== Project Setup
=== Compile Project

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal.
. Using the `git` utility, clone this project to your local workstation.
+
NOTE: For the purposes of these lab instructions, the directory of this cloned project on your local workstation will be referred as: `$DEMO_DIR`.
. Change directory into: `$DEMO_DIR` and build the maven project:
+
----
cd spring-batch-standalone
mvn clean install
----

=== Setting up the database server

For this example, we will be using mysql community edition server. Before installing the demo, we need to setup the server and create the database tables.

. To create database tables.
In the db shell, run these following commands:
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE STUDENTS_RESULT (
      id INT(12) NOT NULL auto_increment primary key,
      last_updated_date datetime,      
      student_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
      dob DATE NOT NULL,
      percentage  double NOT NULL
    );
----
To be sure the tables got created successfully, run one more command:
[source,sql]
----
select * from STUDENTS_RESULT;
----
== Configuring Batch Steps
Spring batch uses a `chunk oriented` processing which refers to reading the data one at a time, and creating `chunks` that will be written out, with in a transaction boundary. One item is read in from an `ItemReader`, handed to an `ItemProcessor`, and aggregated. Once the number of items read equals the commit interval, the entire chunk is written out via the `ItemWriter`, and then the transaction is committed.

=== Configuring a Step

image::/images/configuring-a-step.png[]

The configuration above represents the only required dependencies to create a item-oriented step:

* reader - The `ItemReader` that provides items for processing.
* writer - The `ItemWriter` that processes the items provided by the `ItemReader`.
* transaction-manager - Spring's `PlatformTransactionManager` that will be used to begin and commit transactions during processing.
* job-repository - The `JobRepository` that will be used to periodically store the `StepExecution` and `ExecutionContext` during processing (just before committing). 
* commit-interval - The number of items that will be processed before the `transaction` is committed.

It should be noted that, job-repository defaults to `jobRepository` and transaction-manager defaults to `transactionManger`. Furthermore, the ItemProcessor is optional, not required, since the item could be directly passed from the reader to the writer.

=== ItemReader
Item reader for reading XML input based on StAX is `StaxEventItemReader`
It extracts `fragments` from the input XML document which correspond to records for processing. The `fragments` are wrapped with `StartDocument` and `EndDocument` events so that the fragments can be further processed like standalone XML documents.

Learn more about StAX https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/1.6/tutorial/doc/SJSXP2.html
----
<bean id="xmlItemReader" class="org.springframework.batch.item.xml.StaxEventItemReader"> 
	<property name="resource" value="classpath:students.xml" /> 
	<property name="fragmentRootElementName" value="Student" /> 
	<property name="unmarshaller">
		<bean class="org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller">
			<property name="classesToBeBound">
				<list>
					<value>com.sahoo.spring.batch.standalone.example.model.Student</value>
				</list>
			</property>
		</bean>
	</property>
</bean>
----
Next the fragment of XML document is parsed using JAXB marshaller to java object(Model - Student), which is then pased to item processor.

=== Item Processor
Optional ItemProcessor to perform business logic/filtering on the input records. In this project, we are filtering students having less than 60%.
----
<bean id="itemProcessor" class="com.sahoo.spring.batch.standalone.example.batch.StudentItemProcessor" />
----

=== Item Writer
In this example project, we have used `JdbcBatchItemWriter` to execute a batch of statements for all items.
----
<bean id="databaseItemWriter" class="org.springframework.batch.item.database.JdbcBatchItemWriter">
	<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
	<property name="sql">
		<value>
			<![CDATA[        
				insert into STUDENTS_RESULT(LAST_UPDATED_DATE, STUDENT_NAME, DOB, PERCENTAGE) 
				values (NOW(), ?, ?, ?)
			]]>
		</value>
	</property>

	<property name="ItemPreparedStatementSetter">
		<bean class="com.sahoo.spring.batch.standalone.example.batch.StudentItemPreparedStatementSetter" />
	</property>
</bean>
----
`JdbcBatchItemWriter` need an SQL query and a special callback in the form of `ItemPreparedStatementSetter`. We need a custom setter which implements `ItemPreparedStatementSetter` to handle the conversion between Jodatime LocalDate and MySQL DATE.

== Running the application

You can execute the application using maven command or run as Java Application from IDE.

invoking `mvn exec:java` on the command line will invoke the plugin which is configured to execute the class `com.sahoo.spring.batch.standalone.example.App`

You will see the following console output after successful run:
----

And finally, check the STUDENTS_RESULT in mysql DB.

Records are saved in DB, you can see the students having less than 75% are missing which are filtered in procesor.
