= Spring Batch Standalone Application

toc::[]

== Goals

* Using the `spring-batch` as standalone application.
* Use of StAX Reader to a read chunk of XML file and process the date and finally putting into mySQL DB.
* This is useful while processing large XML files.
* The commit interval and failure scenario can be handled with the leverage of spring batch.

== Overview

This spring-batch demo will demonstrate how the API can be used to process bulk data in controlled way.
These services can be extended to put the failed chunk in a separate file.

== Prerequisites

- JDK 1.8
- Apache Maven 3.2.3

=== Compile Project

. Open a Windows or Unix terminal.
. Using the `git` utility, clone this project to your local workstation.
+
NOTE: For the purposes of these lab instructions, the directory of this cloned project on your local workstation will be referred to as: `$DEMO_DIR`.
. Change directory into: `$DEMO_DIR` and build the maven project:
+
----
cd spring-batch-standalone
mvn clean install
----

=== Setting up the database server

For this example, we will be using mysql community edition server or embedded derby server. Before installing the demo, we need to setup the server and create the database tables.

. Create the database tables.
In the db shell, run these following commands:
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE STUDENTS_RESULT (
      id INT(12) NOT NULL auto_increment primary key,
      last_updated_date datetime,      
      student_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
      dob DATE NOT NULL,
      percentage  double NOT NULL
    );
----
To be sure the tables got created successfully, run one more command:
[source,sql]
----
select * from STUDENTS_RESULT;
----

=== Running the application

You can execute the application using maven command or run as Java Application from IDE.

invoking `mvn exec:java` on the command line will invoke the plugin which is configured to execute the class `com.sahoo.spring.batch.standalone.example.App`

You will see the following console output after successful run:
----

And finally, check the STUDENTS_RESULT in mysql DB.

Records are saved in DB, you can see the students having less than 75% are missing which are filtered in procesor.
